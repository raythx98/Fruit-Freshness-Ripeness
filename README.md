# Fruit-Freshness-Ripeness

### Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict the freshness and ripeness of fruits.

Grocery shopping is an important aspect of our lives and has been ingrained in us since young. Many of us have cre-ative ways of choosing fresh products, including a visual inspection, by looking at signs of oxidation or damage.

However, it is a problem for those who are unable to do so, such as visually impaired people or children and domes-tic helpers choosing fruits for the first time. Our group pro-poses to devise an application with two functions utilising the phoneâ€™s camera function. The first tells apart pictures of fresh fruits and rotten fruits, while the second tells the ripe-ness level of fruits.

This will help visually impaired people or inexperienced shoppers in choosing their fruits, and even aid experienced shoppers in confirming their choices. This application can also help users identify if fruits they have already purchased at home have gone bad, so that users can decide if the fruits are still edible or should be thrown away.
